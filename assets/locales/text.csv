It is an evolution of prokaryotic cells to develop a system of internal membranes, done by assimilating another prokaryote inside of themselves. This allows them to compartmentalize, or ward off, the different processes happening inside the cell and prevent them from overlapping. This allows their new membrane bound organelles to be much more complex, efficient, and specialized than if they were free-floating in the cytoplasm. However, this comes at the cost of making the cell much larger and requiring a lot of the cell's energy to maintain.",
